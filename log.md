# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 1st, 2021 (Preparing for challenge)

**Today's Progress**: Got Github environment and repository ready. Created base website project and hosted on Github pages. 

**Thoughts:** I didn't know the existence of github pages but by following tutorials to host project on it was not difficult. 


### Day 1: October 4th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started on first project (Tribute Page) from FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: While building the website wasn't difficult, I struggled a bit with css styling especially around building responsive layouts. It's been a while since I last did css stylesheets so had to refer back to resources when I felt stuck. I did lose track of time though, so not complaining :)

### Day 2: October 5th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed First project - Tribute Page

**Thoughts** Spent some time working out making the image responsive and used a Bootstrap template for timeline to modify it to my own liking. Happy to submit through the first project.
