# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 1st, 2021 (Preparing for challenge)

**Today's Progress**: Got Github environment and repository ready. Created base website project and hosted on Github pages. 

**Thoughts:** I didn't know the existence of github pages but by following tutorials to host project on it was not difficult. 


### Day 1: October 4th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started on first project (Tribute Page) from FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: While building the website wasn't difficult, I struggled a bit with css styling especially around building responsive layouts. It's been a while since I last did css stylesheets so had to refer back to resources when I felt stuck. I did lose track of time though, so not complaining :)


### Day 2: October 5th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed First project - Tribute Page

**Thoughts** Spent some time working out making the image responsive and used a Bootstrap template for timeline to modify it to my own liking. Happy to submit through the first project.

### Day 3: October 7th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started on next project - Survey Form

**Thoughts** Since I did the web design principles course just over a week ago, I went back to re-do them to refresh memory on form elements and validation. Spent some time with W3School and Google articles on best practices for html form validation. Created a base html file with some skeleton code.

### Day 4: October 8th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued on with Survey Form project

**Thoughts** Continued adding the various form elements. Looked up on W3School on other types of form elements available. Felt a bit stuck on getting the multi-text area working today. 

### Day 5: October 9th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued on with Survey Form project with adding responsiveness to the layout

**Thoughts** Today was all about getting a responsive layout and making it work for smaller devices. CSS Flexbox properties and use of media queries is amazing. It took me a while and several tutorials later to understand the basics of getting flex work. 

### Day 6: October 10th, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Added visual design to Survey Form project and fixed issue with multi-text area and labels for inputs.

**Thoughts** Alot of my time was spent on testing and debugging why certain labels and inputs weren't showing correctly (due to mis-aligned tags). The rest of the time was spent working on getting the right color balance for how I'd like the page to look like. I admit though that I spent more time than I intended on getting the background image.
